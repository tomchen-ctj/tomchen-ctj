I cancelled my plan of reading papers about self-supervised learning in videos due to lack of gpus and fierce competition. (I will still follow hot ones :P)

I should concern more on efficient spatio-temporal feature learner & multi-modality learning in videos. (Read CLIP, Prompt)

- [ ] Finish papers about video in ICCV 2021
- [ ] Multimodal learning from videos(ActionCLIP, etc..)
- [ ] Efficient spatio-temporal feature learner
- [ ] Patent
